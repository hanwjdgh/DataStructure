# C++ Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

## Polymorphism

~~~C++
// Base class
class Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
    cout << "The animal makes a sound \n" ;
  }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
    cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n" ;
   }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
    cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n" ;
  }
};

int main() {
  Animal myAnimal;
  Pig myPig;
  Dog myDog;

  myAnimal.animalSound();
  myPig.animalSound();
  myDog.animalSound();
  return 0;
}

# C++ OOP

OOP = Object-Oriented Programming

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

## Advantages

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## Classes and Objects

ex) Class : Fruit / Objects : Apple, Banana, Mango
    Class : Car   / Objects : Volvo, Audi, Toyota

Class is template for objects, and object is an instance of a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.
